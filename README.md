**Introduction:**
The project aims to analyze and track the patient waiting list data in healthcare facilities from 2018 to 2021. 
This data includes both inpatient (patients staying in the hospital) and outpatient (patients receiving medical treatment without admission) categories. 
The goal is to provide insights into the current status and historical trends of the waiting list, as well as detailed analysis at specialty and age levels.

**Objectives:**
1. Track the current status of the patient waiting list, including both inpatient and outpatient categories.
2. Analyze the historical monthly trend of the waiting list, focusing on inpatient and outpatient categories.
3. Conduct detailed analysis at specialty levels and age profiles to understand the distribution of patients on the waiting list.

**Methodology:**

**1. Data Collection:** Gather patient waiting list data from healthcare facilities for the years 2018 to 2021, including information on inpatient and outpatient categories.

**2. Data Analysis:**

                  2.1 Calculate average and median waiting times for both inpatient and outpatient categories to understand the typical waiting experience of patients.
                  2.2 Summarize the total current waiting list for each year to provide an overview of the demand for healthcare services.
                  2.3 Analyze monthly trends in the waiting list for inpatient and outpatient categories to identify any patterns or seasonality.
                  2.4 Conduct specialty-level analysis to understand the distribution of patients across different medical specialties.
                  2.5 Perform age profile analysis to examine the demographics of patients on the waiting list.

**3. Visualization:**

                  3.1 Create a summary page to present key metrics such as average and median waiting times, total waiting list, and trend analysis.
                  3.2 Develop a detailed page for granular analysis, including specialty-level and age profile visualizations to provide deeper insights into the data.

**4. Interpretation:** 

Interpret the findings from the analysis to provide actionable insights for healthcare administrators and policymakers to optimize patient wait times and resource allocation.

**5. Conclusion** 

In this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the patient waiting list in healthcare facilities, including insights into current status, historical trends, specialty-level distribution, and age profiles.
By analyzing and visualizing this data, stakeholders can make informed decisions to improve patient care and optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.
